This is the README for the YPath-Specification git directory. What does it say?

Here is one source document for the YPath specification: ypathspec.odt. You
are welcome to modify it. If you think another document format is better for
the "master doc" format, please write stuff in that, and use the magic of git
to get it into the repository. At this stage (Oct, 2011) I'm more interested in
producing a well-written specification. 

Cheers.
